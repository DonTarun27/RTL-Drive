# RTL Drive Open-Source Tools
## 1) Icarus Verilog Version 12.0
Icarus Verilog is a popular open-source tool that serves as both a compiler and a simulator for the Verilog Hardware Description Language. It's a free and widely used alternative to commercial simulators like Cadence's Verilog-XL.
Here's a breakdown of Icarus Verilog's key aspects:
### Functionality:
### 1) Compiler
Icarus Verilog compiles Verilog source code, including support for the 1995, 2001, and 2005 versions of the IEEE 1364 Verilog standard, and some extensions, into a target format for simulation or other processing. It also generates netlists for synthesis purposes.
### 2) Simulator
The compiler generates an intermediate format (vvp assembly), which is then executed by the vvp command to simulate the design.
### 3) Synthesis
While primarily a simulator, Icarus Verilog's synthesis capabilities are improving, allowing for the generation of netlists in formats like EDIF. It supports various FPGA devices through its fpga code generator.
### 4) Waveform Viewing
While Icarus Verilog itself doesn't display waveforms, it can generate VCD (Value Change Dump) files that can be viewed with tools like GTKWave.
### 5) SystemVerilog Support
While it supports some SystemVerilog features, full SystemVerilog support is still under development, and it may not fully support advanced verification constructs like those in UVM (Universal Verification Methodology).
### 6) AMS Support
### Diagnostic Capabilities:
Sometimes produces less informative or ambiguous error messages compared to commercial tools.
### Synthesis Limitations:
Primarily designed for simulation, its synthesis capabilities are improving but may not be as robust or feature-rich as dedicated synthesis tools.
